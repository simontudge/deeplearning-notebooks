# Deeplearning Scratchpad with Keras

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate a few toy projects for ideas in deep-learning, particularly using the [keras]() framework.

Most of this is stuff that I have learnt while doing the [google course on deeplearning on udacity]() as well as a few other various blogs and youtube videos.

The content of this repo is:

* A few Ipython Notebooks that show off the main outcomes of all the models.

* A small and informal module that defines a few helper classes for the models.

* Instructions and helper code to get data sources. The data used for these projects is all freely available, but is too large to include here. Instead I simply tell you how to get the data.

* Possibly a blog that describes the work.

## Key models

There are four key things that I do here:

* Conventional deep network, IDEA FOR A PROJECT

* Convolutional Neural Network: In which I train the data on pictures of cats and dogs and ask it to classify. The idea is that the user can ask for any two categories and the API will go to google images and download many pictures of each of these classes. The model will then classify these images as either a result of cat or dog.

* Word2Vec algorithms: A comparison of some of the word to vec algorithms. The project takes DATA SOURCE and bags these words together and demonstrates some interesting things that can be shown with these models.

* RNNs: Uses the LSTM model to generate some fake shakespeare. Can be configured to work with any corpus of text such as the bible or sources.
