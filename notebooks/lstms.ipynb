    "With a little bit more randomness it seems to get stuck in loops, which it is then able to break out of. It occassionally does something more interesting, like ending a big chunk of text with the word Exit, and then doing lots of white space, which is exactly what happens in the text. It also finds one or two more interesting words, such as beauty and promise, it seems to love the letter 's' which is a common letter for a word to start with, so possibly in the absense of any other strong knowledge it might start a word with s, which may be why it often falls back on certain words like street and something. It also uses 'the', 'of', 'to' and 'and' very often, which makes sense."
